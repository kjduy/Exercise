# Exercise
## 1. Overview of the solution
For the development of the exercise I used the Python programming language, since it is easy for me to handle files, and it is not as strict as other programming languages.

Apart from the classes created, I created a python file called main where I take care of importing all the classes created for their respective instantiation and making use of the methods that I create.

In addition, I did the unit tests to check if the result of the functions that I had created was correct and in this way continue with the development of the exercise.

## 2. Explanation of the architecture
For the development of the exercise I used the MVC architecture pattern in which I organized all the python files necessary to solve it together with an extra folder of tests.

Inside the model folder, not having a database such as MongoDB, MySQL, MariaDB, among others, I stored the two test .txt.

Inside the view folder I stored the final method to print the results obtained.

And inside the controller folder I stored all the operations necessary to perform the proper procedure and in this way get the proper response.

## 3. Explanation of the approach and Methodology
The approach that I gave to the exercise was through an object-oriented programming because I find that this type of programming is simple, effective and more organized.

Although at the beginning I chose to use TDD (Test Driven Development), I did not know very well what libraries to use for use in Python, since I have practiced this type of development in React Native, for this reason, I first began to develop the classes together with their methods and once they were done I began to test them using unit tests to check if they worked as I expected and once I verified that the methods worked correctly I proceeded to occupy them in the main, however, there were two methods that I could not test them, hence I had to test them by trial and error when executing the main.
